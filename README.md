Several people have asked about the creation of Figure 2 in this manuscript. Unfortunately, I've lost the original code for the figure. However, I managed to find an alternative. In this demonstration, I present a straightforward method for running multiple simulations for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) analysis. Subsequently, a box plot is generated using the results obtained from these diverse simulations.
